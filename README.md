AirBnB clone project
Project Description: AirBnB Clone
This is an Airbnb project where I will be developing a command interpreter to manage Airbnb objects. This marks the first step in building a complete web application inspired by the Airbnb platform. The initial phase is crucial as it lays the groundwork for subsequent projects involving HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.

In this project, I will be:

Implementing a BaseModel:

I'll create a parent class called BaseModel that will handle the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances. This class will serve as the core foundation for other classes.
Establishing a Serialization/Deserialization Flow:

I'll implement a straightforward process for serialization and deserialization, which will involve converting instances to dictionaries, then to JSON strings, and finally storing them in files. This will be essential for data persistence.
Creating Essential Classes:

I'll develop classes representing various Airbnb entities, such as User, State, City, and Place, all inheriting from BaseModel. These classes will encapsulate the properties and behaviors of the entities they represent.
Designing a Storage Engine:

I'll implement the first storage engine for the project, using file storage to manage data. This engine will abstract the data storage process, allowing for flexibility in switching to other storage systems in the future.
Developing Unit Tests:

I'll create comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of all classes and the storage engine. These tests will ensure the project's components are reliable and robust.
Through this project, I'll gain hands-on experience with object-oriented programming, data serialization, storage systems, and testing, building a strong foundation for developing full-featured web applications.
